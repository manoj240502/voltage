1.Start: Begin the process.

2.Initialize ADC: Set up the ADC for reading.

3.Read ADC Value: Read the digital value from the ADC.

4.Convert ADC Data to Voltage: Use the ADC value to calculate the corresponding voltage.

5.Scale Voltage: Adjust the voltage based on the system requirements.

6.Use Scaled Value: Utilize the scaled analog value for your application.

7.Delay: Optionally, insert a delay before repeating the process.

8.Repeat: Continue the process in a loop if needed.

9.End: Terminate the process.
